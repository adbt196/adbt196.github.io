      <h3>Fabiha Khan</h3>
      <p> This is the first time I have done programming. It was fun to follow lectures and to be able see examples of impressive programs that can be useful in different sectors. During bootcamp I was able to learn Processing a camputer programming language which can be used to demonstrates visual arts. I have also being a simple porgram by using processing. In the program there are two cubes that transversely goes in cross directions, to make the program user interactive I have added stars on the porgram. if the user clicks on the screen it will diplay stars of different colours.</p>

    <h3>Bootcamp 2020: 3D & interactive program</h3>
    <p>
	My first programming project, concluding the 2 week Programming Bootcamp at City (2020). This Processing project demonstrates the understanding 
	of the use of grapichs, shapes, interective functions, and randomness.
	I have sketched a 3D moving shapes and user interactive to draw star everytime the mosue is clicked. 
	I have used a shade of red and purple colour for the cube shapes and I have added a random colour function for the stars.
